300 REM Entry for Kaiju

PRINT "KAIJU:"

PRINT "A giant lizard-like creature that slowly has crystals growing outside of its back."

PRINT "Kaijus tend to be passive aggressive, and are very territorial."

PRINT "They will attack when provoked, but if you keep your distance, they will leave you be... most of the time."

PRINT "Refrain from going near any of the large blue crystals inside the cave."

310 REM Entry for fed

PRINT "FED:"

PRINT "This gootrax has a more wolf like appearance, bearing pink eyes,"

PRINT "This gootrax was actually created purely on accident,"

PRINT "after security forgot to remove all accessories from a subject, and a developing gootrax latched onto a hat."

PRINT "It was among the first to escape containment,"

PRINT "causing a small outbreak after a coworker attempted to do a horrible Jackson impression after tipping a fedora on their head."

PRINT "Feds are usually calm and collected, but see humans as animals,"

PRINT "and nothing more. They look down upon humans, but aren't necessarily annoyed around them either;"

PRINT "more-so taking to teasing and mocking humans at any point they can, commonly seen scoffing at their presence."

PRINT "For further reference, please don't wear hats indoors."

RETURN



320 REM Entry for figs
PRINT "FIGS:"

PRINT "Appearing to be insects of indeterminate species,"

PRINT "Figs are insectile Gootraxians that appear frequently in and around the Laminax facility garden."

PRINT "While lightweight enough to be capable of flight, they do not seem to do so very often and much prefer to traverse the facility on foot."

PRINT "They instead use their wings as a method of communication, using the produced vibrations to signal to other Figs what could be possible threats."

PRINT "It is not recommended that you eat the fruit that falls from the tree in the center of the garden."

RETURN



330 REM Entry for ghost fox

PRINT "GHOST FOX:"

PRINT "Appearing to resemble ghostly spirits wandering the Laminax facility,"

PRINT "Ghost Foxes are timid Gootraxians that tend to stray away from light and use their translucent,"

PRINT "incorporeal bodies to hide away from attackers that may attempt to harm them."

PRINT "While mostly gaseous, they are capable of discharging hefty shocks of electricity,"

PRINT " and use them to incapacitate those they want to infect. However, they seem to fear humans and tend to only fight back in self-defense."

PRINT "Be careful handling any tasers you may find around the facility and try not to drop them in water."

RETURN



340 REM Entry for hazzy

PRINT "HAZZY:"

PRINT "A cat-- er.. fox?? .. like gootrax that loves to hide itself on the inside of hazmat suits. While they do avoid attacking humans,"

PRINT " they do like striking when a human is weakened. They are harmless if a subject is healthy, although."

PRINT "Hazzy seem very curious and playful, but tend to stray away from large crowds. These smaller gootrax love affection in small doses."

PRINT "Hazzy appear to hold grudges on humans who attack them. Many can be seen wearing hazmat suits,"

PRINT " and using items around the facility as weapons to attack those unfortunate enough to have picked a fight with them."

PRINT "Only wear a hazmat suit if you are ABSOLUTELY SURE the material is safe."

PRINT " If you do find yourself ensnared by a Hazzy, keep your health tip top shape at all costs."

350 REM Entry for lemon shork

PRINT "LEMON SHORK:"

PRINT "Large shark Gootraxians with a unique double pair of eyes, Lemon Shorks appear to be the result of a lemon combining with a regular Shork."

PRINT "These Gootraxians can be aggressive and highly protective of others of their kind. They tend to form groups with others as well,"

PRINT " and appear to be most active in low light, as their two highly developed pairs of eyes enable them to see clearly during these conditions."

PRINT " Their bodies contain a chemical not too dissimilar to lemon juice, and getting it in your eyes may leave you blinded and in a fair amount of pain."

PRINT "Do not feed lemon slices to the Shorks."

RETURN



360 REM Entry for shade

PRINT "SHADE:"

PRINT "Similar to the Fed, this gootrax is wolf like, has bright green eyes, and is wearing a pair of fake, rubber like shades."

PRINT "This gootrax developed the same way the Fed did, but in a more safer space, a breakout in the staff lounge."

PRINT "Surprisingly the breakout was quickly stopped, as Shades were shown to be, though a little less intelligent than Feds, a lot nicer (though equally as dangerous)."

PRINT " Shades show more respect for humans and more so curiosity. They are extremely protective, and work as good guards."

PRINT "While this specimen has not shown any aggression as of writing this log, please do not just randomly give security sunglasses in hopes of them 'lightening up'."

RETURN



370 REM Entry for shork

PRINT "SHORK:"

PRINT "The most common of the aquatic test failures, the Shork is a gootrax that lurks in the water contained areas of the facility."

PRINT "While as of recent certain rooms have been flooded due to them biting at the water pipes,"

PRINT " these gootrax have shown to be some of the most aggressive due to their original animal nature."

PRINT "While harnessing this aggression would be good for our final goal, these tests have only shown for them to act out as wild animals,"

PRINT " hunting mainly in their waters to protect their territory."

PRINT "Beware of the fins that roam the deep waters."

RETURN



380 REM Entry for slime hound

PRINT "SLIME HOUND:"

PRINT "A large, canine like creature with a feathery dinosaur like tail."

PRINT "They have the same skull like mask that Slime Pups have."

PRINT " They seem to be more aggressive and more mature Slime Pups, almost taking a parental role."

PRINT "They are notably over protective with the pups, even going as far to punch at aggressive Panthers to keep them safe."

PRINT "While they may be over protective, if you show hospitality and kindness to a pup around them,"

PRINT "more than often they spare you from their rage. ...That is, if they trust you."

RETURN



390 REM Entry for slime pup

PRINT "SLIME PUP:"

PRINT "A small, dog sized creature that is translucent,"

PRINT "with a skull like mask on the front. They can vary in colors."

PRINT "These creatures are the first of the neutral species that have been created, and have been noted to follow humans and infected around,"

PRINT "expecting food and pets. They're often childlike,"

PRINT " but on rare occasions the aggressive biters are seen to grow in size, and eventually form into a Slime Hound."

PRINT "Slime Pups are often extremely curious, but lazy. They sleep around a lot, and will even sleep on your back if you let them."

PRINT " If one is bothering you, just give it a treat or something."

400 REM Entry for toxic rabbit

PRINT "TOXIC RABBIT:"

PRINT "Cunicular Gootraxians capable of producing a similarly suffocating,"

PRINT " albeit different gas to the one formerly inside the rooms with gas canisters,"

PRINT " Toxic Rabbits frequent the facility's support cave where the enclosed space makes escape for unsuspecting humans nigh-impossible."

PRINT "The chemical they emit is differentiated from the gas once in the area with the canisters as it has been determined to be dense chlorine gas,"

PRINT " leaving any who inhale it feeling an intense and painful burning sensation in their eyes as well as finding difficulty breathing."

PRINT "Beware of falling chemical vats."

RETURN



410 REM Entry for witchbrew
PRINT "WITCHBREW:"

PRINT "A Gootraxian with bat-like attributes, Witchbrews have been observed to be wreaking havoc across the LAMINAX facilities."

PRINT " Their playful and mischievous behavior prompts them to socialize with other gootraxians, despite their widely shunned presence."

PRINT "The Witchbrew was created entirely on accident! A developing gootraxian had contaminated an ordinary can of Witchbrew soda,"

PRINT " mutating the sugary drink with unusual and undocumented properties; one of which being transforming the victim into the Witchbrew gootraxian."

PRINT "For future reference, do not drink any peculiar looking soda from vending machines."

RETURN



420 REM Entry for melon shork

PRINT "MELON SHORK:"

PRINT "This mutation of the Shorks occurred from an odd reaction to the rind and interior of a watermelon,"

PRINT "fully developing properly only in dimly lit areas. These gootrax have evolved their own light source,"

PRINT "having an odd flame between their horns to see better in the dark. This flame does not hurt when touched,"

PRINT " and gives off a sweet melon like smell."

RETURN



430 REM Entry for psuedo shork

PRINT "PSUEDO SHORK:"

PRINT "This gootrax is a lanky pink and white stripped shark like creature that likes to hide in dimly lit areas."

PRINT "They prefer dim lighting rather absolute darkness, thus leading to the team to believe this Shork has adapted to the more poorly lit areas of their tank."

PRINT "Unlike regular Shorks, this branch of gootrax is very puppy like, interacting with subjects and looking at them like a curious animal more so."

PRINT "However don't be fooled by its cute exterior, it is but a facade. As soon as it can catch an opportunity to strike, it WILL take it."

RETURN



440 REM Entry for sinox

PRINT "SINOX:"

PRINT "With dazzling bioluminescent patterns,"

PRINT " Sinox use their fur that produces a unique chemical similar to glowstick fluid to light up the dark environments they wander during blackouts."

PRINT "Strangely aggressive to other Gootraxians, they tend to stay well away from large groups of them but seem to enjoy the company of Slime Pups instead,"

PRINT " helping guide them around the facility with their glow. The luminous chemical fluid their markings produce also doesn't seem to lose its luminosity overtime,"

PRINT " making it a strong point of interest for research. They tend to use lab coats lying around for warmth in the cold and dark caves, and as a byproduct leave this glowing chemical behind in them,"

PRINT " infecting anyone who happens to wear one that's been contaminated."

PRINT "Be careful wearing any lab coats during blackouts, they could be contaminated."

RETURN
